## 1. Pseudo-polynomial DP solution to the Number-Partition Problem

The problem can be modified slightly so that we can find a dynamical programing solution: Given a sequence of numbers $A = \\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n\\}$ with sum $\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = t$, determine if there is a way to select a subset of the numbers such that their sum is $\lceil\frac{t}{2}\rceil$, which means that the rest of the numbers add up to ($\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\rfloor$)
